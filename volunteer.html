          Below is a list of currently open roles within the Organizing
          Committee. These positions are distinguished between Committee-level
          roles and Long-term Volunteer roles. What’s the difference?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Committee Roles</b> usually have an increase in responsibility
            and commitment. They are also expected to attend all regular
            committee meetings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Long-term Volunteer Roles</b>, aka Super-Volunteers, are usually
            roles that fit into a planning committee. They are not expected to
            attend regular meetings of the Organizing Committee and report to a
            committee level lead. These roles tend to have less responsibility
            and commitment throughout the year.

          both year-round and event-based volunteers, the VC is the most vital
          link in the entire festival's chain of awesomeness.
