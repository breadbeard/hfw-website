          HONK! Fest West is a free, non-profit, community music festival driven
          by the energetic performance of street bands in public spaces.
          Completely volunteer-planned and organized, HONK! festivals are a part
          of a global renaissance of community street band culture. For three
          days in Seattle area parks and streets, 25+ bands deliver music and
          celebration that is accessible to all.
        </p>
        <p>
          HONK! bands are typically acoustic and mobile, often politically aware
          and articulate, and always high spirited. There is a rich community
          ethic among HONK!ers, who use their music to erode the barriers
          between professional and novice, and between audience and performers.
          Although uniforms are sometimes used as a performance tool,
          individuality is key, and group members often hail from all range of
          classes, ethnicities, ages, and backgrounds. Perhaps most importantly,
          the HONK!ers’ ultimate goal is to have fun, to relish the art of
          making fun as a form of individual and collective transcendence, and
          to encourage others to see and do the same.

      Our festival is part musical gathering, part community activism. Many of
      us play an instrument. Some don’t. But all of us have found that live,
      energetic street music—no matter which side of the mouthpiece you are
      on—brings audience and band together in something like family. A raucous,
      playful family.
